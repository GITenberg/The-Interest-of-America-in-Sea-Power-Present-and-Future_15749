description: In this volume, the highly respected naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan
  attempts to arouse in his fellow Americans an awareness of their naval responsibilities,
  framing his argument not only in terms of national security but also touching on
  international commerce. Included are the chapters, "Hawaii and our Future Sea Power,"
  "Possibilities of an Anglo-American Reunion," and "Strategic Features of the Caribbean
  Sea and the Gulf of Mexico," among others.
